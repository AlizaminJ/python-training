# Troubleshooting for Windows
# 1. Uninstall opencv with: pip uninstall opencv-python
# 2. Download a wheel (.whl) file from this link (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv) and install it with pip.
# Make sure you download the correct file for your Windows version and your Python version. For example, for Python 3.6 on Windows 64-bit you would do this:
# pip install opencv_python-3.2.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
# 3. Then try to import cv2 in Python again. If there's still an error, then please type the following again in the command line: pip install opencv-python
# 4. Now you should successfully import cv2 in Python.

# Troubleshooting for Mac
# If pip install opencv-python didn't go well please install OpenCV for Python 2 and use Python 2 to run the programs that contains cv2 code.
# Its' worth mentioning that Python 2 is installed by default on Mac, so no need to install Python 2. Here are the steps to correctly install OpenCV:
# 1. Install brew:
# Open your terminal and execute the following: /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# 2. OpenCV depends on GTK+, so please install that dependency first with brew (always from the terminal): brew install gtk+
# 3. Install OpenCV with brew: brew install opencv
# 4. Open Python 2 by typing: python
# 5. Import cv2 in Python: import cv2
# If you get no errors, that means you installed OpenCV successfully.

# Troubleshooting for Linux
# 3. My opencv installation didn't go well on Linux
# 1. Please open your terminal and execute the following commands one by one:
# sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
# cmake -D WITH_QT=ON ..
# make
# sudo make install
# 2. If that doesn't work, please execute this: sudo apt-get install libopencv-*
# 3. Then install OpenCV with pip: pip install opencv-python
# 4. Import cv2 in Python. If you get no errors, that means you installed OpenCV successfully: import cv2
